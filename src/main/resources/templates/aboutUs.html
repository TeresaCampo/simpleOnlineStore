        <h1>Our journey</h1>
        <p>
            OceanPulse was founded by a team of dedicated surfers who wanted to revolutionize the surfboard industry.

            surfboards that reflect our commitment to excellence and innovation. Our goal is to deliver boards that not
            only meet but exceed the expectations of surfers around the world.</p>
